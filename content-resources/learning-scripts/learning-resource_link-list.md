- Combining Scrum with Kanban and Extreme Programming
  - `summary`: This article explores how Agile software development can be enhanced by combining Scrum with Kanban and Extreme Programming (XP). It introduces Scrum as a foundational framework for project management, focusing on organised processes and defined roles within time-boxed 'Sprints'. The piece then details Kanban as a method for optimising workflow through visual boards and limiting work in progress, offering greater flexibility than Scrum's fixed Sprints. Finally, Extreme Programming (XP) is presented as a set of engineering practices, like Test-Driven Development and pair programming, that ensure high technical quality and adaptability of the software produced. By integrating these three methodologies, the article argues that teams can create a more effective, adaptable, and higher-quality development process that tackles both project management and technical execution.

- Scrum And eXtreme Programming (XP)
  - `summary`:This source serves as an insightful guide comparing and contrasting Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP), ultimately arguing that a professional Scrum team will incorporate XP practices. It systematically breaks down the two methodologies across several categories: values, roles, events, artefacts, and the "Definition of Done". The author highlights how XP's emphasis on feedback, courage, and respect aligns closely with Scrum principles, while also providing specific, often non-negotiable, practices that enhance a Scrum team's effectiveness, such as daily deployment to production and pair programming. The piece concludes that choosing between Scrum and XP is irrelevant as XP acts as a valuable set of practices within the Scrum framework, leading to hyper-performing teams and higher quality product delivery.

- Scrum Process with XP Engineering Practices - InformIT
  - `summary`: This article from InformIT, authored by Kane Mar and Ken Schwaber in 2002, outlines how Scrum processes can be effectively combined with Extreme Programming (XP) engineering practices for software development. The core idea is to leverage Scrum for managing the development workflow through iterative 'Sprints' and daily stand-ups, while utilising XP to guarantee high software quality with techniques such as 'test-first coding' and 'continuous integration'. It details the specific elements of both Scrum (like 'Product Backlog' and 'ScrumMaster') and XP (including 'simple system design' and 'pair programming') as implemented in a hypothetical 'Project X', illustrating how these agile methodologies work in tandem. The article's purpose is to demonstrate a practical approach to building robust software through enhanced visibility and a focus on incremental improvement.

- Scrum und Extreme Programming (XP)
  - `summary`: This document clarifies that while Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) are both agile methodologies, they are completely independent of each other, meaning one does not necessitate the other. However, they can complement each other effectively, especially if Scrum is used to encapsulate XP practices. Both methods share philosophical roots outlined in the Agile Manifesto, which prioritises individuals and interactions, functional products, customer collaboration, and responding to change. The text also highlights Scrum's scalability, detailing its application in large projects through mechanisms like Meta-Scrum.

- What Is Extreme Programming (XP)? It's Values, Principles, And Practices
  - `summary`: This text introduces Extreme Programming (XP) as a software development methodology within the broader agile framework. It outlines XP's core philosophy, which is built upon values, principles, and practices designed to help small to mid-sized teams produce high-quality software and adapt to evolving requirements. The document further elaborates on XP's distinct focus on technical aspects of software development and its detailed engineering practices, contrasting it with other agile methodologies like Scrum by highlighting its prescriptive approach to "how" development work is done. Ultimately, the source advocates for XP as "the developers' agile," suggesting its practices are crucial for maintaining agility and delivering continuous value.
